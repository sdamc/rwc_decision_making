# rwc_decision_making
Project for decision making analysis of the Tier 1 nations in the Rugby World Cup 2023

Definitions:
Only the matches between the top 3 ranked nations on each Group plus every playoff game will be analyzed. Videa analysis is very time consuming : )
Only plays outside of the 22m line will be analysed, because the players inside the 22m zone have the luxury to kick the ball out on the full.
Only the plays where the players make key decisions will be registered. Common passes like the scum half passing to a forward pod or a fly half passing to a center far from the defensive line wont get into the analysis.
